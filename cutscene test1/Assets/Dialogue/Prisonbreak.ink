As you entered the world you find yourself standing in a unfamiliar space , questioning on what your doing to do. You look around and realized you have been teleported into the pizza world. the floor is dough the sky is mass cheese and tomato sauce and that fresh smell of bread, you cant help but feel awe

Or thats what you think huh player feeling special this only happened twice and your not the first and you wont be the last and lets be real you are here by accident

 /// since your here you took notice and realized your sitting on the president pizza himself but he looks oddly familiar but we are not going to say but we dont want a law suit Anyways you sat on the president he is mad and he sent his men to go to arrest you after a few minutes of chasing you got arrest ha dumbass 

2 since your here you took notice and realized your sitting on the president pizza himself but he looks oddly familiar but we are not going to say but we dont want a law suit, you hear the crowd yelling at you
who is this random object that is moving he aint a pizza and he is ugly (just like you in real life huh?) its always people like him even though it only happend twice but still he hates the president why would he ruin it huh he must hate pizza lets cancel him on pizzter#npc 
Get him pizzas arrest that man and arrest him how dare he ruin my beautiful speech #speaker: president

After you got arrest you decided to think on how to get out of here since you know your the only human here and your surrounded by pizza who knows what they are gonna do to you well i know but you dont and we are not gonna foreshadow unless? Nah lets not 

You came up with you options start a riot or wait the time

 What do you decide to do?
  * [Start a riot?]
  -> riot("you decided to start a riot")

  + [Wait the time]
  -> chosen("really think im going to let you wait HA hell no we want you to enjoy the game ")

  You {decision}
->main
=== riot(decision)===
you used your 0 charmisa to gather men to help you and they all laugh and you even we are laughing at you its funny shit man 
But since im a dev i will use my magical powers to help you huzzah you can speak pizza langauge and you can speak to women and pizza its a shame you cant get that in real life huh unless you are married or a women then you get nothing HA beat that 

You gathered all the pizza men you possibly can get until you realized a ghost , a spirit. The spirits speaks to you
