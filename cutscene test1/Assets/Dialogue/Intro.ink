Welcome Chicago pizza where your lack of skills and talent will be put on full display and we as developers get to laugh and you get to cry
You play as a guy who gets teleported to the pizza dimension and be corrupt or not and you get to decide what you want to do in that dimension 
We will mock you for every decision and move you because we like to have fun but to disguise us being mean. We do this so we can "motivate you so you rise to the challenge" we want you to die . So lets see how your going to die shall we?

  The game begins as this humble man doing things that you gamers never heard of before a shower while he doing something that you never 
  do he decides something. Does he order pizza or not 
  ->main    
=== main ===
 What do you decide to do?
  * [order pizza]
  -> pizza("Order pizza")

  * [go back in shower]
  -> chosen("Go back in shower")
    
  ==chosen(decision)==
  You {decision}
->main  

=== pizza (decision)===  
you thought it was a good idea to use your phone in the shower what a dumb ass and no it wasnt me , okay maybe it was but you cant do anything but leave but dont, we need money i mean support and love from out players

You called the pizza place and ordered a pizza but wait "enter generic shock scene" oh what, what is that shocking coming from your phone oh wait your dumbass forgot that phone arent waterproof
As the phone blows up the portal opens and you get sent to that dimension




    -> END
