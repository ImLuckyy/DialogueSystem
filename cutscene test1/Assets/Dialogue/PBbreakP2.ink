Lets do this we need to stop the president pizza he ruined lives by taking their toppings and becoming the ultimate pizza he is the reason why we have a class divide all of us was fine before until the pepperoni nation attacked but now we you the master of all the toppings you can create peace between the nation  #speaker:spirit

The first thing you need to do is wipe out all the guards that are blocking you and your fellow pizzas then find the wardens office he will have a key and a note that will contain a secret hopefully it appears today #speaker
