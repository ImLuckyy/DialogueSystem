# DialogueSystem
 So this is a system that im making for a project but it will be released everntually but here is a small snippet
 This there will be multiple dialogue options but for now i have it so it saves your choices , like a choice matter game
 
 The controls:
 WASD to move
 I to interact
 SPACE to continue to text
 
 There is player prefs so if you want to experiment on this feel free
 
 TrevorMock youtube video did help with the base systems
