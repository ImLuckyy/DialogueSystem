# DialogueSystem
 So this is a system that im making for a project but it will be released everntually but here is a small snippet
 This there will be multiple dialogue options but for now i have it so it saves your choices , like a choice matter game
 
 The controls:
 WASD to move
 I to interact
 SPACE to continue to text
 
 There is player prefs so if you want to experiment on this feel free
 
 TrevorMock youtube video did help with the base systems
 But this will be updated to the full project soon
